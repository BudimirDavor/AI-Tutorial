        <button class="collapsible collapsible1">A brief History of Artificial Intelligence</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Artificial intelligence is a buzzword today, although this term is not new.</p>
            
            <p>In 1956, a group of avant-garde experts from different backgrounds decided to organize a summer research project on AI. Four bright minds led the project; John McCarthy (Dartmouth College), Marvin Minsky (Harvard University), Nathaniel Rochester (IBM), and Claude Shannon (Bell Telephone Laboratories). </p>
            
            <p>The primary purpose of the research project was to tackle "every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence that can in principle be so precisely described, that a machine can be made to simulate it." </p>
            
            <p>The proposal of the summits included </p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Automatic Computers</li>
                <li>How Can a Computer Be Programmed to Use a Language?</li>
                <li>Neuron Nets</li>
                <li>Self-improvement</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <button class="collapsible collapsible1">Type of Artificial Intelligence</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Artificial Intelligence is an umbrella term. There are two subsets of Artificial Intelligence:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Machine Learning</li>    
              <li>Deep Learning</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <button class="collapsible">1 - Machine Learning</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence in which a program or machine uses a set of algorithms to find patterns in the dataset(s). Above all, we don’t have to write individual instruction for every action. As machine learning models capture more and more data, they become smarter and self-improving.</p>
            
            <p>Further, Machine Learning can be sub-categorized into three subsets:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Supervised Machine Learning</li>
                <li>Unsupervised Machine Learning</li>
                <li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Applications of Machine Learning</h4>
            
            <ul>
                <li><b>Amazon Recommendation System:</b> Amazon’s recommendation system works on Machine Learning algorithms. In order to find patterns and similarities in our search, it leverages its unique design to recommend similar search results.</li>
                <li><b>Machine Learning used in Fraud Detection:</b> Today, as the number of fraud cases increases, machine learning plays an important role in solving this problem. Due to its unique design, fraud detection algorithms help distinguish between authorized and fraudulent transactions.</li>
                <li><b>Machine Learning used in Social Media:</b> Facebook uses Machine Learning algorithms to suggest friends to us with its <b>‘People You May Know‘</b> feature. Also, it uses Machine Learning for face detection, i.e., recognizing faces in a group photo. Isn’t it a wonderful application of Machine Learning?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <button class="collapsible">2 - Deep Learning</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Deep learning is a sub-field of machine learning. Deep learning does not mean the machine learns more in-depth knowledge; it means the machine uses different layers to learn from the data. The depth of the model is represented by the number of layers in the model. For instance, Google LeNet model for image recognition counts 22 layers. </p>
            
            <p>In deep learning, the learning phase is done through a neural network. A neural network is an architecture where the layers are stacked on top of each other. </p>
            
            <h4>Applications of Deep Learning</h4>
            
            <ul>
                <li><b>Predicting Earthquakes:</b> This is one of the most important applications where the field of Deep Learning is playing a key role. Unquestionably, time is an important factor when it comes to the prediction of earthquakes. Fortunately, with Deep learning, we are now able to boost the computation time by almost 50,000 percent.</li>
                <li><b>Adding sounds to silent movies:</b> This is a fascinating application for deep learning. The idea behind this deep learning model is to produce sounds that exactly match with a silent video. The DL models are provided with thousands of videos and audio files with which they try to learn by separating video frames for different categories of sounds. Thus, when a new video is given to them for adding audio to it, they use this learning for further prediction. Also, they use the convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and LSTM (long short-term memory) for achieving for their successful implementation.</li>
                <li><b>Netflix Recommendation System:</b> People using Netflix are familiar with its recommendation system. It uses Deep Learning for recording the responses of different kinds of audiences. The Deep Learning models are designed in such a way that they record the history of watching, time of watching, and our show preferences to recommend shows. It really saves a lot of human effort.</li>

        <button class="collapsible collapsible1">AI vs. Machine Learningg</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Most of our smartphone, daily device or even the internet uses Artificial intelligence. Very often, <b>AI and machine learning are used interchangeably by big companies that want to announce their latest innovation. However, Machine learning and AI are different in some ways.</b> </p>
            
            <p>Artificial Intelligence is a computer that is given human-like properties. Take our brain; it works effortlessly and seamlessly to calculate the world around us. Artificial Intelligence is the concept that a computer can do the same. It can be said that AI is the large science that mimics human aptitudes. </p>
            
            <p>Machine learning is a distinct subset of AI that trains a machine how to learn. Machine learning models look for patterns in data and try to conclude. In a nutshell, the machine does not need to be explicitly programmed by people. The programmers give some examples, and the computer is going to learn what to do from those samples. </p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="collapsible collapsible1">What makes Artificial Intelligence so popular?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Artificial Intelligence is about incorporating the human abilities to a machine by designing algorithms such that these algorithms involve self-learning and provide the machine with the ability to think like the way humans do, by which the machine would be able <b>to solve problems without explicit human inputs.</b></p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="collapsible collapsible1">Where is AI used? Examples</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>AI has broad applications- </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificial intelligence is used to reduce or avoid the repetitive task. For instance, AI can repeat a task continuously, without fatigue. In fact, AI never rests, and it is indifferent to the task to carry out</li>
                <li>Artificial intelligence improves an existing product. Before the age of machine learning, core products were building upon hard-code rule. Firms introduced artificial intelligence to enhance the functionality of the product rather than starting from scratch to design new products.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>AI is used in all the industries, from marketing to supply chain, finance, food-processing sector. According to a McKinsey survey, financial services and high tech communication are leading the AI fields. </p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="collapsible collapsible1">Why is AI booming now?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>A neural network has been out since the nineties with the seminal paper of Yann LeCun. However, it started to become famous around the year 2012. Explained by three critical factors for its popularity are: </p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Hardware</li>
                <li>Data</li>
                <li>Algorithm</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Machine learning is an experimental field, meaning it needs to have data to test new ideas or approaches. With the boom of the internet, data became more easily accessible. Besides, giant companies like NVIDIA and AMD have developed high-performance graphics chips for the gaming market. </p>
            
            <h4>Hardware</h4>
            <p>In the last twenty years, the power of the CPU has exploded, allowing the user to train a small deep-learning model on any laptop. However, to process a deep-learning model for computer vision or deep learning, you need a more powerful machine. Thanks to the investment of NVIDIA and AMD, a new generation of GPU (graphical processing unit) are available. </p>
            
            <h4>Data</h4>
            <p>Deep learning is the structure of the model, and the data is the fluid to make it alive. Data powers the artificial intelligence. Without data, nothing can be done. Latest Technologies have pushed the boundaries of data storage. It is easier than ever to store a high amount of data in a data center. </p>
            
            <p>Internet revolution makes data collection and distribution available to feed machine learning algorithm. If you are familiar with Flickr, Instagram or any other app with images, you can guess their AI potential. There are millions of pictures with tags available on these websites. Those pictures can be used to train a neural network model to recognize an object on the picture without the need to manually collect and label the data. </p>
            
            <h4>Algorithm</h4>
            <p>Hardware is more powerful than ever, data is easily accessible, but one thing that makes the neural network more reliable is the development of more accurate algorithms.</p>
            
            <p>Primary neural networks are a simple multiplication matrix without in-depth statistical properties. Since 2010, remarkable discoveries have been made to improve the neural network </p>
            
            <p>Artificial intelligence uses a progressive learning algorithm to let the data do the programming. It means, the computer can teach itself how to perform different tasks, like finding anomalies, become a chatbot.</p>

        <button class="collapsible collapsible1">Summary</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Artificial intelligence and machine learning are two confusing terms. Artificial intelligence is the science of training machine to imitate or reproduce human task.</p>
            
            <p>A scientist can use different methods to train a machine. At the beginning of the AI's ages, programmers wrote hard-coded programs, that is, type every logical possibility the machine can face and how to respond. </p>
            
            <p>When a system grows complex, it becomes difficult to manage the rules. To overcome this issue, the machine can use data to learn how to take care of all the situations from a given environment. </p>
            
            <p>The most important features to have a powerful AI is to have enough data with considerable heterogeneity. For example, a machine can learn different languages as long as it has enough words to learn from. </p>
            
            <p>AI is the new cutting-edge technology. Ventures capitalist are investing billions of dollars in startups or AI project. McKinsey estimates AI can boost every industry by at least a double-digit growth rate. </p>
